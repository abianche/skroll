# Skroll: Cross-Platform Narrative Editor

**A modern cross-platform tool for writing and playing branching stories, built with Tauri, React, and Rust.**

---

## ✨ Vision
This project aims to provide writers and developers with a simple yet powerful editor for **interactive fiction**.  
Think *Inklewriter* or *Twine*, but designed to run **everywhere**: desktop, mobile, and web.  

With this tool you can:
- Write branching stories in a clean editor.
- Visualize story flow and choices.
- Playtest stories instantly inside the app.
- Export to portable formats (JSON) and use them in your own games.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **[Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/)** — cross-platform shell (desktop + mobile).  
- **React + TypeScript** — frontend editor and preview UI.  
- **Rust** — story parsing, validation, and runtime engine.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Follow Tauri [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites)

### Tooling & Versions
- Node.js: uses `.nvmrc` (Node 22 LTS). If you have `nvm`, run `nvm use` to match.
- pnpm: use Corepack to manage pnpm version: `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`.
- Rust: repo pins `stable` via `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Quick installs (pick what applies):
- macOS/Linux Node (nvm):
  - `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`
  - `nvm install` (reads `.nvmrc` and installs Node 22)
- pnpm via Corepack (bundled with Node 16.10+):
  - `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`
- Rust via rustup:
  - `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
  - `rustup default stable` (optional; the repo already pins stable)

Editors:
- The repo includes `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting.
- VS Code: suggested extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json` (Rust Analyzer, Tauri).

### Clone & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abianche/skroll.git
cd skroll
nvm use             # match Node version from .nvmrc
corepack enable     # manage pnpm via Corepack
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

This should open a Tauri window with the scaffolded React app.
